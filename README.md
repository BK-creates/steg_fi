# Steg-FI

Steganography, derived from the Greek words *steganos* (covered) and *graphy* (writing), focuses on concealing the existence of a message rather than encrypting its content. Unlike cryptography, which scrambles messages, steganography embeds data within carriers like text, audio, images, videos, or network traffic to ensure covert communication.  

- **Text Steganography**: Uses whitespace manipulation, linguistic techniques, or hidden markers to embed messages in emails, social media, or documents.  
- **Audio Steganography**: Hides data in sound signals using LSB insertion, phase coding, or spread spectrum methods, useful in covert messaging and watermarking.  
- **Video Steganography**: Embeds information in video frames, motion vectors, or compression redundancies for discreet communication.  
- **Image Steganography**: Conceals data in digital images for covert sharing, forensic analysis, and tamper detection.  
- **Network Steganography**: Embeds data in network traffic or exploits covert channels for undetectable communication.  

With digital advancements, steganography is both a tool for secure communication and a potential vector for cyber threats.
