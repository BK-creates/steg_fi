# Steg-FI

Steganography focuses on concealing the existence of a message rather than encrypting its content. Unlike cryptography, which scrambles messages, steganography embeds data within carriers like text, audio, images, videos, or network traffic to ensure covert communication.  

Text Steganography: Involves manipulating whitespace, using linguistic techniques, or using hidden markers to embed messages in emails, social media, or documents.  
Audio Steganography: hides data in sound signals using LSB insertion, phase coding, or spread spectrum methods. It is useful for covert messaging and watermarking.  
Video Steganography: Embeds information in video frames, motion vectors, or compression redundancies for discreet communication.  
Image Steganography: Conceals data in digital images for covert sharing, forensic analysis, and tamper detection.  
Network Steganography: Embeds data in network traffic or exploits covert channels for undetectable communication.  

With digital advancements, steganography is both a tool for secure communication and a potential vector for cyber threats.
